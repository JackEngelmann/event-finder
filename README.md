## Context

This project originated from an "I have a business idea, I just need an IT person"-situation. The idea was to build a website to find local events (starting in Dresden). We abandoned the project around the time of Covid-19.

## Run with Docker Compose

Install docker, then run `docker compose up` to start the server.
